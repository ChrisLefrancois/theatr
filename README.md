# Interactive Theatre Companion

Interactive Theatre Companion is a prototype interactive web application, designed for teachers and students. The application has a variety of activities that allow students to discover the play, and teachers to track their students progress.

The current prototype is considered phase 1, with all of the data pertaining to one play, and no customizability for the activities or the play's information by the user. An ideal phase 2 would scale to allow for all of this, as well as multiple classrooms per teacher and student.

## Challenges during development

Though straightforward, the development of the application was not without it's challenges. As the activities are quite diverse, making sure that each one fit into our database schema was often difficult, and required creative solutions.

In particular, the crossword was one of the most demanding, as it's integration with our existing code was vexing at times. In the end, however, it was successfully integrated into the application.

Developing our own technique to allow for user access codes was a fun challenge as well, and resulted in an interesting, though simple for phase 1, solution.

## Future

The application has a wealth of potential for scalability. As theatre companion guides are commonplace in the industry, translating them into a web application would allow for large scale access. Integration into a scholastic setting would allow for ease of information disemination for teachers and students alike.

Moving forward, some larger issues that would present themselves include allowing activities to be customizable by the theatres for each of the plays. Since each activity can be so different, allowing for these variations would require a fair amount of work within the codebase.

Another challenge would be allowing the theatre to customize the play information itself. The phase 1 prototype information was hardcoded, so no database model exists to allow it to be modified by a user. A large modification of the model would be necessary to allow for a theatre-admin type user, with play and activity creation and modification abilities, as well as storing images, videos, and audio, and generating access codes for a larger number of students and teachers.

Though some of these challenges seem daunting, we believe they would still be within the scope of the phase 1 development team, as with the completion of phase 1, much of the ground work has been laid for these phase 2 ideas.
